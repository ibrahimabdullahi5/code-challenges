Functionality
The main functionality of the application is contained within the speedDetector function, which performs the following tasks:

Prompts the user to enter their speed.
Validates the user's input to ensure it is a valid number.
Compares the entered speed to the predefined speed limit.
Calculates demerit points if the speed exceeds the speed limit.
Alerts the user with the number of demerit points or notifies them if their license is suspended.

Usage
To use the Speed Detector application, simply include the provided JavaScript code in an HTML file and open it in a web browser. When prompted, enter the speed in km/h. The application will then provide feedback based on the entered speed.

Constants
speedLimit: The speed limit is set to 70 km/h.
kmPerDemeritPoint: Each demerit point corresponds to 5 km/h over the speed limit.

Steps
The user is prompted to enter their speed.
The input is converted to a floating-point number using parseFloat().
If the input is not a number (NaN), an alert is shown, and the function exits.
If the speed is below the speed limit, an alert displays "ok".
If the speed exceeds the speed limit, demerit points are calculated by dividing the excess speed by kmPerDemeritPoint.
If the demerit points exceed 12, an alert notifies the user that their license is suspended.
Otherwise, an alert displays the number of demerit points.
